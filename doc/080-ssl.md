The recent update of PG introduces SSL support. Install the newest version of PG
as follows:

Lein:

~~~clojure
[com.github.igrishaev/pg-client "0.1.8"]
[com.github.igrishaev/pg-ssl "0.1.8"] ;; optional, for a custom SSL context
~~~

Deps:

~~~clojure
{com.github.igrishaev/pg-client {:mvn/version "0.1.8"}
 com.github.igrishaev/pg-ssl {:mvn/version "0.1.8"}}
~~~

## Setup

The are two ways to set up an SSL connection to the database. The first, and
simple, is to set the `:ssl?` boolean flag to true and just connect:

~~~clojure
{:host "some.cloud.host.com"
 :port 5432
 :ssl? true
 ...}
~~~

In this case, the entire SSL pipeline is held by Java. It tries to find the
corresponding keys and certificates using the standard KeyStore and TrustStore
which you configure on your own.

The second and more flexible way is to provide a custom SSL context to the
connection map. It must be an instance of the `javax.net.ssl.SSLContext`
class. Building such an instance from scratch is quite miserable though. To make
your life easier, there is a thin wrapper on top of the great [Less Awful
SSL][less-awful-ssl] library that takes a map of certificates and keys and
returns an instance of `SSLContext`. Since it requires a third-party library,
it's shipped as a standalone package pg-ssl. Add it to the project:

~~~clojure
[com.github.igrishaev/pg-client "0.1.8"] ;; lein
# or
{com.github.igrishaev/pg-ssl {:mvn/version "0.1.8"}} ;; deps
~~~

Now pass the `:ssl-context` parameter in addition to `:ssl?`. It's a map with
the string keys `:key-file`, `:cert-file`, and `:ca-cert-file`:

~~~clojure
(ns foo.bar
  (:require
    [pg.ssl :as ssl]))

{:host "some.cloud.host.com"
 :port 5432
 :ssl? true
 :ssl-context
 (ssl/context {:key-file "/path/to/client.key"
               :cert-file "/path/to/client.crt"
               :ca-cert-file "/path/to/root.crt"})}
~~~

The `:ca-cert-file` parameter might be missing if just `:key-file` and
`:cert-file` are enough.

~~~clojure
(ssl/context {:key-file "/path/to/client.key"
              :cert-file "/path/to/client.crt"})
~~~

## EDN Config

Often, we store the configuration in an EDN file. To declare SSL context there,
prepend it with a reader tag called `#pg/ssl-context`:

~~~clojure
{:ssl? true
 :ssl-context #pg/ssl-context {:key-file ...}}
~~~

When reading EDN, pass that tag to the `:readers` map as follows:

~~~clojure
{'pg/ssl-context pg.ssl/ssl-context-reader}
~~~

The tag wraps the map with a function that builds the `SSLContext` from it.

Some cloud platforms give you only the root certificate. In that case, generate
both the client key and the the client certificate on your own using the root
certificate. Something like:

~~~bash
umask u=rw,go= && openssl req -days 365 -new -nodes -subj '/C=US/ST=Test/L=Test/O=Personal/OU=Personal/emailAddress=test@test.com/CN=test' -keyout client.key -out client.csr
umask u=rw,go= && openssl x509 -days 365 -req  -CAcreateserial -in client.csr -CA root.crt -CAkey server.key -out client.crt
~~~

When generating the certificates, pay attention to the `CN` field which is
"test" in our case. In terms of PostgreSQL, it should match the database
user. Different users will have different certificates.

## Testing

The SSL functionality is difficult to test in Docker so I've got to run a native
instance. Here is a brief setup.

- In `postgresql.conf`, enable the `ssl` parameter and specify paths to the
  files:

~~~
ssl=on
ssl_cert_file='/Users/ivan/work/pg/certs/server.crt'
ssl_key_file='/Users/ivan/work/pg/certs/server.key'
ssl_ca_file = '/Users/ivan/work/pg/certs/root.crt'
~~~

- In `pg_hba.conf`, enable the "cert" validation type for SSL connections:

~~~
hostssl all all all cert
~~~

Finally, create a user with a name that matches the `CN` field:

~~~sql
create user <CN-field> with password '******';
~~~
